# MTGRules_UWP
MTGRules UWP Windows Store App

**This project is discontinued and has been replaced by https://github.com/ivancea/MTGRules_Android/, an Android version.**

The main objective of this application is to provide a history of **Magic: The Gathering** rule sets, and the ability to compare, search and navigate them.

This was my first UWP application, a pet project I made because there were no other application in the Microsoft Store with a nice rules navigation. *You probably won't find here good coding practices (In the context of a UWP application).*
