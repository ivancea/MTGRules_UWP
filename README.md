# MTGRules_UWP
MTGRules UWP Windows Store App

*This project has been replaced by the one in https://github.com/ivancea/MTGRules_Xamarin, a multi-platform solution created with Xamarin.*

The main objective of this application is to provide a history of **Magic: The Gathering** rule sets, and the ability to compare, search and navigate them.

This was my first UWP application, a pet project I made because there were no other application in the Microsoft Store with a nice rules navigation. *You probably won't find here good coding practices (In the context of a UWP application).*
